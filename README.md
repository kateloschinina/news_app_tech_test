# Tech Test for News Company

Build a news headline aggregator
----
Build a website that shows a list of news headlines from ####. You may use Developer APIs to achieve this.

Provide a search box for users to search for headlines containing specific words (i.e. searching for "brexit" should return a list of brexit-related headlines).

Optionally, provide pagination for results, at 20 results per page.

This website should be:
* Server-rendered
* Progressively enhanced
* Responsive
* Accessible


For bonus points, the site should:
* Be built using Javascript and node.js
* Be deployed on Heroku
* Not rely too heavily on client-side frameworks (i.e. Angular, React) or libraries like jQuery
* Have a similar look and feel as ####.com
* Be performant over 3G networks


It'd be really awesome if, on top of all that, your site:
* Uses Origami Components
* Works offline
